2.5,New Additions to MER 2.5,New Indicators,,,There are no new indicators for MER 2.5.,,,
2.5,New Additions to MER 2.5,New Disaggregations,OVC_SERV,TRUE,"OVC_SERV has been restructured to distinguish between beneficiaries in the three OVC_SERV program models: OVC Comprehensive, DREAMS, and OVC Preventive. The OVC Comprehensive disaggregate is reported by program participation status, age/sex, Exited or Transferred, and a new disaggregate to distinguish between OVC child beneficiaries aged 18-20 years and caregivers aged 18+. The DREAMS and OVC Preventive disaggregates are reported by age/sex.",,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Changes in Reporting Frequency,PrEP_NEW,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY21.,,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Changes in Reporting Frequency,PrEP_CURR,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY21.,,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Changes in Reporting Frequency,GEND_GBV,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from annually to semi-annually in FY21.,,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Modifications to Existing Indicators,KP_PREV,TRUE,"In order to standardize KP disaggregations across the clinical cascade indicators, KP_PREV disaggregations were updated to: FSW, MSM, PWID, TG, and People in prisons and other closed settings. The disaggregations of TG SW, TG non-SW, MSM SW, MSM non-SW, PWID male, and PWID female were retired.",,,
2.5,Removals from MER 2.4,Retired Indicators,HRH_CURR,TRUE,"Starting in FY21, HRH_CURR will be retired. HRH Data will be collected via the HRH Inventory. Data collection through the HRH Inventory, along with more robust analysis and programmatic action, will allow PEPFAR to better capture the scope and nature of its staffing investments in order to optimize health worker utilization to advance epidemic control and inform sustainability planning once epidemic control is achieved. See Appendix G for additional information.",,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Indicator Definition Clarifications,OVC_HIVSTAT,TRUE,Clarifying language was added to state that the denominator of OVC_HIVSTAT will be auto-calculated from the OVC_SERV “OVC Comprehensive” disaggregate. Only beneficiaries enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive program should be reported in OVC_HIVSTAT.,,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Indicator Definition Clarifications,TX_RTT,TRUE,"Language was added to TX_RTT to state that patients reported in TX_RTT must have been experienced an interruption in treatment during any previous reporting period, successfully restarted ARVs within the current reporting period, and remained on treatment until the end of the reporting period.",,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Indicator Definition Clarifications,TX_ML,TRUE,Clarifying language was added to outline the relationship between TX_ML and TX_RTT.,,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Language Changes,,,"The following changes were made in order use patient-centered language:
Retention was changed to “continuity of treatment”.
Lost to Follow-Up (LTFU) was changed to “interruption in treatment”. Interruption in treatment (IIT) is defined as no clinical contact or ARV drug pickup for greater than 28 days since the last expected contact.",,,
2.5,Adjustments from MER 2.4,Central Support,,,"Financial support at the national or subnational level in areas where PEPFAR is not providing support at the site level is characterized as Central Support. Starting in FY21, PEPFAR Central Support will be collected as third support type, separate from DSD and TA. TX_PVLS will be added to the list of Central Support indicators. Central Support data will continue to be reported annually. For additional information, please refer to the section on PEPFAR Support to Communities and Sites.",,,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,New Indicators,SC_ARVDISP,TRUE,"SC_ARVDISP is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q2 of FY20. SC_ARVDISP measures the dispensing of ARV bottles at the facility level. In addition, SC_ARVDISP measures the uptake, transition, and maintenance of patients on optimized ARV regimens as well as the phasing out of non-optimal regimens.",,,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,New Indicators,SC_CURR,TRUE,SC_CURR is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q2 of FY20. SC_CURR measures the quantity of ARV stock available at the time of reporting to provide insight into the on-the-shelf availability of each ARV used for HIV treatment at the facility level. Data from SC_CURR can be coupled with data from SC_ARVDISP to determine how long the quantity of stock will last based on dispensing.,,,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,New Indicators,TX_RTT,TRUE,TX_RTT is a quarterly indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q1 of FY20. TX_RTT counts those patients who are lost to TX_CURR for more than 28 days past the last expected clinical contact who return to treatment and restart ARVs in the reporting period. This indicator counts those previously ART experienced individuals who reinitiate ARVs after being off treatment for ≥28 days (and therefore LTFU).,,,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,New Disaggregations,TX_CURR,TRUE,"Two new disaggregations have been introduced for quarterly TX_CURR reporting beginning in FY20: (1) reporting TX_CURR results by KP type and (2) reporting TX_CURR by the months of ARVs dispensed to each patient to assess the uptake of multi-month dispensing (MMD) in PEPFAR-supported sites.

As a reminder, the definition of TX_CURR was modified beginning in FY 2019 based on a new definition of lost-to-follow-up (LTFU). Patients who have not received ARVs within four weeks (i.e., 28 days) of their last missed drug pick-up should not be counted in TX_CURR.",,,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,New Disaggregations,TX_PVLS,TRUE,KP disaggregations have been added to both the numerator and denominator.,,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Changes in Reporting Frequency,TX_ML,TRUE,"The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY20 to align with other treatment indicators and improve triangulation with TX_NEW, TX_NET_NEW, TX_CURR, and TX_RTT.",,Table 4,
2.4,New Additions to MER 2.4,Site and SNU Attributes,,TRUE,"PEPFAR collects administrative, epidemiologic, and service-related data about PEPFAR-supported facilities and subnational units (SNUs) that helps to better illuminate where services should be provided, where services are actually are provided, who is delivering these services, and what is the service capacity. Some of these attributes are routinely collected in form of MER indicators (e.g., HRH_CURR, EMR_SITE), others are collected at the time a facility is added to a master facility list and subsequently DATIM (e.g., facility name, geographic coordinates), and others are collected during the annual PEPFAR planning cycle.

Through the collection of these data, PEPFAR strives to have more complete information available on service provision facility infrastructure. Use of these data facilitates improved decision-making when country programs are determining what services should be targeted to the populations in greatest need of these services by geographic locations.

New site attributes have been added for reporting in FY20. For a full list of all required site and SNU attributes, refer to Appendix D. Additional details on the collection of these attributes will be included in the COP 20 guidance and the FY20 MOH-Data Alignment Activity.",,Appendix D,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Changes in Reporting Frequency,TX_ML,TRUE,"The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY20 to align with other treatment indicators and improve triangulation with TX_NEW, TX_NET_NEW, TX_CURR, and TX_RTT.",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Indicators,AGYW_PREV,TRUE,"Indicator reporting shifted in FY19 from being cumulative for the entire DREAMS programs to a to snapshot, reflecting AGYW service completion as of the past 6 months at Q2 and the past 12 months at Q4. For FY20, the numerator and denominator disaggregates have been reorganized and a denominator disaggregate has been added to capture AGYW enrolled in DREAMS that have started but not yet completed a DREAMS service/intervention in the reporting period. These changes will provide the ability to better assess completion coverage.",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Indicators,HTS_RECENT,TRUE,"HTS_RECENT has been restructured to combine the previous numerator and denominator into a single numerator to mirror HTS_TST. As such the previous indication disaggregation (assay, RITA, and not documented) was redefined to align better with reported results and recency testing algorithms. All assay results will be reported under rapid test for recent infection (RTRI) and confirmed results through viral load testing as part of the RITA will be reported as a subset, where available.

HTS_RECENT results will be collected by modality and test result beginning in FY20 to improve alignment and triangulation with HTS_TST in order to understand which modalities are identifying recent infections. The pregnancy status disaggregation was removed due to the addition of modality as pregnancy status can be ascertained from the PMTCT ANC1 and PMTCT Post ANC1 modalities.",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Indicators,TB_PREV,TRUE,"The denominator was changed from the number of ART patients who “are expected to complete a course of TPT” to those who were initiated on any course of TPT during the previous reporting period. The
therapy type (regimen) disaggregates for the numerator and denominator were moved from the indicator to the guiding narrative questions. The APR calculation for TB_PREV was changed from a snapshot indicator, to being summed over time (i.e., previous calculation: APR=Q4, new calculation: APR=Q2+Q4).",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Indicators,TX_ML,TRUE,"The outcome disaggregations have been simplified to the following categories: died, lost to follow-up, transferred out, and refused (stopped) treatment. Sub-disaggregations were added to the lost to follow-up outcome for patients LTFU after being on treatment for >3 months vs. patients LTFU after being on treatment <3 months. This distinction was added to highlight the critical nature of early retention for successful longer-term retention among those persons newly initiating ART, especially otherwise healthy or younger adults.",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,LAB_PTCQI,TRUE,Laboratory and point-of-care testing site categories have been updated to include “rapid test for recent infection” and remove “other”.,,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,PP_PREV,TRUE,"A new disaggregate has been added to the “Testing Services” disaggregate group for “Test not required based on risk assessment” for those priority populations not eligible for HTS based on HTS screening.
In-text clarifications were also added to confirm that conducting an HIV risk assessment meets the required HTS component for PP_PREV.",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,TX_PVLS,TRUE,"“Not documented” testing indication removed as efforts should have been initiated since this
indicator was introduced, as described in the previous releases of the MER guidance, to move results to either
“routine” or “targeted.”",,,
2.4,Adjustments from MER 2.3,Indicator Definition Clarifications,OVC_SERV,TRUE,"Clarifying language was added to OVC_SERV explaining exited, transferred, and graduation disaggregates should be reported cumulatively at Q4. In addition, there is an expanded definition of “child” OVC beneficiary to include children aged 18 to 20 still completing secondary education or an approved economic intervention intended to secure the livelihood of an OVC aging out of the program. Language was also added regarding counting active DREAMS beneficiaries who are not otherwise actively enrolled in the OVC program under OVC_SERV. Lastly, there is clarifying language added regarding the definition and number of caregivers per household.",,,
2.4,Removals from MER 2.3,Retired Indicators,SC_STOCK,TRUE,"Indicator has been removed in order to introduce improvements to the supply chain indicators, including SC_ARVDISP and SC_CURR, which allows for more proactive action to address bottlenecks in the supply chain.",,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,AGYW_PREV,TRUE,AGYW_PREV is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in FY19. AGYW_PREV is a DREAMS-specific indicator to measure how many adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are being served in the DREAMS program and whether all AGYW in DREAMS have received the intended layered services and interventions to ensure that they remain HIV-free.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,CXCA_SCRN,TRUE,CXCA_SCRN is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q4 of FY18. CXCA measures the percentage of HIV-positive women on ART screened for cervical cancer.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,CXCA_TX,TRUE,"CXCA_TX is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q4 of FY18. CXCA_TX measures the percentage of cervical cancer screen-positive women who are also HIV-positive and on ART that were eligible for and received cryotherapy, thermocoagulation or LEEP.",,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,HTS_INDEX,TRUE,HTS_INDEX is now a standalone indicator to monitor and help guide PEPFAR programming for index testing services. Reporting for HTS_INDEX will begin in Q1 of FY19. HTS_INDEX is the first MER indicator to monitor PEPFAR programming related to HIV index testing services (often referred to as partner notification or contact tracing services). This indicator includes a cascade that will help to better understand the scale and fidelity of the index testing services provided by PEPFAR-supported programs.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,HTS_RECENT,TRUE,"HTS_RECENT is a quarterly indicator introduced for reporting beginning in Q1 of FY19. Testing individuals that are newly diagnosed with HIV-1 for recent infection is an emerging programmatic area of emphasis for PEPFAR. HTS_RECENT measures the percentage of newly diagnosed HIV-positive persons aged
≥15 years with a test for recent infection result of ‘recent infection’ during the reporting period. As countries progress toward epidemic control, surveillance of newly diagnosed persons will ensure that interventions target those at highest risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. One approach is to identify recent HIV infections, defined as those acquired within approximately the last one year. Incorporation of rapid tests for recent HIV-1 infection into routine HIV testing services will enable the establishment of a surveillance system to quickly detect, monitor, characterize, and intervene on recent infections among newly diagnosed HIV cases. Data collected from a recent infection surveillance system can also be used to fine-tune a country’s programmatic response through prioritized programming and resource allocation.

2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,PrEP_CURR,TRUE,PrEP_CURR is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in FY19. PrEP_CURR measures the number of individuals receiving oral PrEP during the reporting period and is an important addition to the MER to help PEPFAR programs understand how many clients are being sustained on PrEP after initiation.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Indicators,TX_ML,TRUE,TX_ML is a semi-annual indicator introduced for reporting beginning in FY19. TX_ML is intended to drive improved tracing of patients to ensure patient outcomes are accurately documented. It is the first PEPFAR indicator to collect information on mortality among patients on ART and in care. The indicator also strives to better understand the magnitude of previously undocumented patient transfers.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Disaggregations,HTS_TST,TRUE,A new facility-based testing modality has been introduced: Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF. Please refer to the HTS_TST indicator reference sheet for additional details.,,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Disaggregations,PP_PREV,TRUE,"A new, optional priority populations type disaggregate was added to this indicator to capture the specific priority populations accessing prevention services. Age/sex-specific priority populations were not added to this disaggregate group (e.g., AGYW) because these can be calculated using the mandatory age/sex disaggregates collected within the indicator.",,,
2.3,New Additions to MER 2.3,New Disaggregations,TX_TB,TRUE,The denominator has been updated to include a new disaggregate for “positive result returned.”,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Changes in Reporting Frequency,PrEP_NEW,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from quarterly to semi-annually in FY19 to align the prevention indicators.,Table 4,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Changes in Reporting Frequency,TB_ART,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY19 to align with the ART-related indicators and TB_STAT.,Table 4,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Changes in Reporting Frequency,TB_STAT,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY19 to align with HTS_TST.,Table 4,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Changes in Reporting Frequency,TX_PVLS,TRUE,The reporting frequency moves from annually to quarterly in FY19 to ensure that the treatment cascade can be reviewed quarterly and to emphasize the importance of regularly monitoring viral load coverage and suppression.,Table 4,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Indicators,HRH_CURR,TRUE,"The reporting of HRH_CURR by the number of full-time equivalents is no longer required. HRH_CURR has been simplified to collect the total number of staff (regardless of FTE). In addition, a new data element has been added to capture the amount of funding spent on health care workers by cadre and support type.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Indicators,PMTCT_EID,TRUE,"The denominator has been updated to include HIV+ pregnant women identified after ANC1, including those women who test positives later in pregnancy, at labor and delivery, and throughout the breastfeeding period. The positive results for these women will be captured under the newly added HTS modality, Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF and will be summed with the positives (new and known) from ANC1 (i.e., PMTCT_STAT_POS) to obtain the total denominator.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,OVC_HIVSTAT,TRUE,The status type disaggregates have been modified. The sub-disaggregate under “No status reported” formerly called “Test not indicated” will now be “Test not required based on risk assessment” to simplify the language.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,OVC_SERV,TRUE,"Age/sex and program status (i.e., active or graduated) disaggregations have been combined.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,PMTCT_ART,TRUE,Age disaggregations were added to the “maternal regimen type” disaggregate to align with PMTCT_STAT. Age disaggregations were not previously collected for PMTCT_ART.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,PREP_NEW,TRUE,"The KP type disaggregation for this indicator has been updated. “Other key population” has been removed and replaced with “people who inject drugs” and “people in prisons and other closed settings” so that all key population disaggregate group options align between HTS_TST, TX_NEW, PrEP_CURR, and PrEP_NEW.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,TB_ART,TRUE,Age/sex and “ART status” disaggregations have been combined.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,TB_PREV,TRUE,Age/sex and “Type of TB preventive therapy by ART Start” disaggregations have been combined for both the numerator and the denominator.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,TB_STAT,TRUE,Age/sex disaggregations were updated from coarse-only to fine age bands to allow TB_STAT to auto-populate HTS_TST via the TB modality and to align with the age bands for TB_ART.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,TX_TB,TRUE,Age/sex and “ART Status” disaggregations have been combined for the numerator. Age/sex and “Start of ART by Screen Results” disaggregations have been combined for the denominator.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Modifications to Existing Disaggregations,VMMC_CIRC,TRUE,Age disaggregations were added to the “HIV Status and Outcome” disaggregate in order for VMMC HTS results to auto-populate into the HTS_TST indicator. Note that the age disaggregations align with HTS_TST to allow for auto-population. This means the <4 disaggregations differ slightly from the indicator itself.,,,
2.3,Removals from MER 2.2,Retired Indicators,TX_RET,TRUE,Indicator has been removed in order to incorporate the new TX_ML indicator and strengthen reporting on TX_PVLS.,,,
2.3,Removals from MER 2.2,Retired Disaggregations,OVC_SERV,TRUE,"The age/sex/service DREAMS-related disaggregate was removed and replaced with a new indicator, AGYW_PREV, to improve the tracking of layered services and interventions.",,,
2.3,Removals from MER 2.2,Retired Disaggregations,PMTCT_STAT,TRUE,The age-only disaggregate was removed to minimize duplicative reporting. Age is already captured under the status and age disaggregate group.,,,
2.3,Removals from MER 2.2,Retired Disaggregations,TX_NEW,TRUE,The “confirmed diagnosis of TB” disaggregate was removed as TB_ART results have moved to quarterly reporting.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Indicator Definition Clarifications,GEND_GBV,TRUE,Clarifying language was added to the “disaggregate descriptions and definitions” section of the indicator to ensure that clients are not double-counted under the indicator.,,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Indicator Definition Clarifications,OVC_SERV,TRUE,"Clarifying language added to this indicator reference sheet to better emphasize that only children (and their caregivers) that actually received one or more services in each of the preceding two quarters should be counted in this indicator. OVC that have registered for the program (i.e., been enrolled and assessed) but have not yet received any services should not be counted in the results. The purpose of this indicator is to assure that beneficiaries are being reached promptly and regularly with needed support. 
In addition, illustrative eligible interventions that qualify a beneficiary to be counted as active have been added, for both children and caregivers. For services that are not captured in the list, local USG funding agency approval must be received in order to count these services toward active OVC status.
Next, minimum graduation benchmarks have been established to ensure that PEPFAR programs have aligned objectives for progressing children and their caregivers to a minimum level of stability. Children and caregivers in a household move from active to graduated status together when each has met the minimum benchmarks (reflecting the family-centered nature of OVC programming).
Lastly, clarifying language has been added to the indicator reference sheet regarding the calculation of annual totals and the timeframe of data submitted for Q4 disaggregates. Individuals should only be counted once at Q4 reporting (i.e., active, graduated, transferred, and exited disaggregates are mutually exclusive).",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Indicator Definition Clarifications,PMTCT_ART,TRUE,"Language has been added to clarify that only women initiating on treatment prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy (ANC) should be counted under PMTCT_ART. Women newly initiating or coming to the facility during L&D and breastfeeding should be counted under TX_NEW and/or TX_CURR, but not under PMTCT_ART.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Indicator Definition Clarifications,PMTCT_STAT,TRUE,"Language has been added to clarify that subsequent testing events during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding will be reported under the new HTS_TST modality: Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF. See the PMTCT_STAT and HTS_TST indicator reference sheets for further details.",,,
2.3,Adjustments from MER 2.2,Indicator Definition Clarifications,TX_CURR,TRUE,Language under the “How to Collect” section has been updated to better clarify PEPFAR reporting expectations in light of recent DQAs and to describe alignment with the new TX_ML indicator.,,,
2.3,New Addition to MER 2.3,Age Disaggregations,See Table 2,FALSE,"Data from the Population-Based HIV Impact Assessments (PHIA) has provided valuable insight into the progress many PEPFAR countries are making towards achieving the 95-95-95 goals in all ages and sexes. Significant disparities in incidence and viral suppression among adults ages 25-49-year led PEPFAR to reassess the required reporting age bands and further disaggregate the 25-49-year old age band into the following four age bands: 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-49 in FY18. Further review and analysis of age- disaggregated data during COP 2018 resulted in a shift towards disaggregation by standard five-year-age bands to align with the WHO guidance (https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/strategic-information-guidelines/en/) for electronic systems.

Reporting on the new MER 2.0 (v2.3) age bands will be introduced beginning in Q1 of FY 2019. As discussed in the previous MER guidance as well as in the FY 18 Consolidated Guidance for Data Collection and Use in PEPFAR and the COP 2018 PEPFAR Fiscal Year 2018 Country Operational Plan (COP) Guidance for Standard Process Countries, country teams were required to discuss any barriers or challenges to reporting the new finer age disaggregations during FY 18 to address these challenges in order to fully report on new finer age bands beginning in FY19. **Methods of extrapolating or estimating age disaggregated results data are not permitted.** If you have questions, contact your SI Advisor and SGAC_SI@state.gov. The table below describes the evolution of the standard, required age bands for PEPFAR reporting from FY 2015 through FY 2019. Note that there are some indicator-specific variations to these requirements.

2.3,New Addition to MER 2.3,Updated DATIM Functionality,Auto-Population of HTS_TST Modalities,FALSE,"New efforts to reduce data entry redundancy and reinforce the relationships between indicators are being instituted in this iteration of the MER guidance. The definitions for the PMTCT (ANC1), TB, VMMC, and index HIV testing services modalities have been aligned with their respective parent status indicators (i.e., PMTCT_STAT, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and HTS_INDEX). Results will no longer be entered for these modalities through the HTS_TST indicator directly but will instead be entered into the parent indicator and then auto-populated into HTS_TST. For example, results entered for TB_STAT newly tested positives will auto- populate into the TB modality for HTS_TST within DATIM. DATIM users will still see these modalities on the data entry screen but will no longer be able to enter data directly into the modalities. Once data is entered for the partner indicator, it will be copied into the relevant data entry form for the corresponding HTS modality. For further details, see the diagram below and review the HTS_TST reference sheet.

testing. While age/sex disaggregates are requested for this indicator, it’s important to remember that this indicator is assessing the distribution of self-test kits so the disaggregated data should be focused on the individual the self-test kit was distributed to and not necessarily the end use of the test kit.

2.2,New Addition to MER 2.2,New Indicators,PMTCT_HEI_POS,TRUE,"PMTCT_HEI_POS is a new indicator for reporting beginning in Q1 of FY18. This indicator is being introduced in response to challenges with the former PMTCT_EID_POS indicator disaggregation in the collection of test results among those tests that were performed within the same quarter. Previously, a significant proportion of results were reported as “unknown” each quarter since results reporting was based on the date of DBS collection, but turnaround times from DBS collection to
result return to site are often ≥4 weeks. DBS collected within 4 weeks of the end of the quarter generally did not have a result reported.
PMTCT_HEI_POS addresses these monitoring challenges by collecting only the positive results that returned during the reporting period. PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator was introduced to describe both early testing coverage and linkage of HIV+ infants to ART and to ensure collection of the number of infants identified as HIV+ in the first year of life that would be accurate and meaningful to program monitoring and planning. PMTCT_EID will continue to collect the virologic tests performed.

In MER 2.0 there are no full indicators that are conditional, but only additional disaggregations that are conditional on additional funding and / or programming. In MER 2.0 there are two main types of conditional indicator disaggregation’s; 1) having received additional funds for special programming, i.e., DREAMS SNU (with or without additional DREAMS funding) or, 2) having received permission for the OGAC SI advisor to complete coarse age disaggregations instead of the finer age disaggregations. This is considered conditional based on approval from S/GAC.
3. **Optional** indicator disaggregates, should be completed by those for which the indicators is useful to determine the success of their program (e.g., KP National and Subnational data) or for which the partner has strong methodological sources (KP catchment area -denominator) or for which it is both relevant and safe to enter the data at the site and/or community level (KP disaggregations for TX_NEW, HTS_TST, please see additional guidance on Key populations changes).",,,
2.1,Adjustments from MER 2.0,Not specified,KEY POPULATIONS,FALSE,"In order to better understand the HIV epidemic among key populations and program response, there have been several substantial changes to the data collection for key populations. These changes have positively affected both the KP and PP prevention program indicators as well as the clinical cascade indicators.
For the prevention program, to align PEPFAR indicators better with WHO and UNAIDS indicators, the key populations have been separated MSM and transgender and added Prisoners and other people living in enclosed places. Additionally, KP disaggregations were added to the PrEP_NEW indicator.
Where appropriate these key population have also been added as disaggregations to indicators in the clinical cascade including, HTS_TST and TX_NEW. These were not added to TX_CURR or TX_RET or TX_PVLS, specifically as identifying as KP may not be life-long and may change over time and therefore not possible to collect retrospectively. To better determine the KPs of interest for each indicator, please review Appendix 1, the key population classification document.

2.1,Adjustments from MER 2.0,Not specified,TB/HIV,FALSE,"The TB indicators have been enhanced this year to better correspond to global changes in TB policy and to better reflect the increasing emphasis on patient outcomes. We have maintained the TB_STAT indicator (and increased the frequency of collection to quarterly) and have added a disaggregate to TX_NEW and TB_ART to identify the number of new patients who have TB at the time of enrollment. These will allow us to characterize the HIV testing of TB patients, and the linkage to HIV treatment.
Elements of TB_SCREEN/ TB_SCREENDX (COP16 target setting) have been transformed into a new indicator, TX_TB, which will allow us to document the number of patients who are screened for TB, and the proportion of those who are eventually started on TB therapy. This indicator also captures the number of ART patients who had a specimen sent for bacteriologic diagnosis (and type) of active TB disease.
Corresponding to the sharper focus of the End TB Strategy, and the emphasis on TB prevention, we have transformed TB_IPT into a new indicator, TB_PREV, which will now be required. By identifying the proportion that completes or is maintained on continuous preventive therapy, we will be able to monitor relevant outcomes, rather than just the number that initiate TB preventive therapy. These indicators will allow us to document the care cascade from TB screening to the desired outcomes: TB therapy or TB preventive therapy.

These may not align with end USG fiscal year results. These data should be collected continuously at the subnational level as part of service delivery areas. Data should be in line with GARPR and UNAIDS reported data where available, although may differ due to different reporting periods. Pin the narratives, please indicate what months the data include (e.g., October 2015-September 2016; or July 2015 to June 2016).

Low final scores (reds and yellows) from these CEEs highlight potential issues with service delivery, site performance or oversight, and/or documentation of patient results. The SIMS 2.0 Linkage Reference Table provides a listing of all SIMS 2.0 CEEs that have been directly linked to a given MER indicator; linkage data may be used for data triangulation activities to inform and contextualize MER results.",,,
2.1,Adjustments from MER 2.0,Not specified,Expenditure Analysis (EA) & MER 2.0 Alignment,FALSE,"PEPFAR Expenditure Analysis (EA) is conducted annually in order to better understand the costs the USG incurs to provide a broad range of HIV services and support and subsequently use this information to improve program planning. Additional information about  EA methodology, process, and timeline  can be found in the EA annual Guidance. PEPFAR results reported through the MER are linked to EA  program areas to calculate a “unit expenditure” (UE). The UE represents the amount (in USD) PEPFAR spent per beneficiary reached within a program area tied to the relevant indicator. Unit expenditures are only calculated when appropriate indicators are available and align with EA expenditure reporting, and therefore EA uses only a selection of MER indicators.
The general framework of EA-MER underscores 1) The benefit of logic checks that ensure consistency and completeness in MER reporting within and across partners in an OU, and 2) that reporting to EA and MER are aligned – i.e. expenditures are reported in the same locations (at EA SNU level, typically district or province) and program areas in which results are reported _(please note: expenditures can also be reported in SNUs and/or program areas in which results are not reported)_.",,,
2.1,Adjustments from MER 2.0,Not specified,DREAMS Specific Guidance,FALSE,"In addition to required MER reporting, it is essential that all DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) countries – Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe – ensure that all implementing Partners in DREAMS SNUs report their results for and use data from all DREAMS-related indicators and their required disaggregations. DREAMS countries are encouraged to monitor interventions progress using custom indicators for program components that do not have existing MER indicators (e.g., contraceptive method mix, condom promotion and provision).

2,Adjustments from MER 1.0,Not specified,Disaggregated monitoring,FALSE,"There are 3 categories of MER indicator disaggregations for the MER 2.0, which can be seen in the indicator reference sheets and the data entry screens.
1. **Required**, this indicates that this indicator disaggregate is required for all countries that have programming for this area. Which includes means that the country supports a program area, defined by budget and targets set during the COP process -- then it is required that there also be results. Required program indicators may consist of both DSD and TA results.
2. **Conditional** indicator disaggregates include those for which some additional condition must be filled. In MER 2.0 there are no full indicators that are conditional, but only additional disaggregations that are conditional on additional funding and / or programming. In MER 2.0 there are two main
types of conditional indicator disaggregation’s; 1) having received additional funds for special programming, i.e., DREAMS funds or 2 having received permission for you SI advisor to complete coarse age disaggregations instead of the finer. This is conditional on approval from S/GAC.
3. **Optional** indicator disaggregates, should be completed by those for which the indicators is useful to determine the success of their program (e.g., KP National and Subnational data) or for which the partner has strong methodological sources (KP catchment area -denominator) or for which it is both relevant and safe to enter the data at the site and/or community level (KP disaggregations for TX_NEW, HTS_TST, please see additional guidance on Key populations changes).

2,Adjustments from MER 1.0,Not specified,Key Population,FALSE,"In order to better understand the HIV epidemic among key populations and program response, there have been several substantial changes to the data collection for key populations. These changes have positively affected both the KP and PP prevention program indicators as well as the clinical cascade indicators.
For the prevention program, to align PEPFAR indicators better with WHO and UNAIDS, the key populations have been separated MSM and transgender and added Prisoners and other people living in enclosed places.
Where appropriate these key population have also been added as disaggregations to indicators in the clinical cascade including, HTS_TST and TX_NEW. These were not added to TX_CURR or TX_RET or TX_PVLS, specifically as identifying as KP may not be life-long and may change over time and therefore not possible to collect retrospectively. Additional KPs were added as a disaggregation for the PrEP_NEW indicator. To better determine the KPs of interest for each indicator, please review Appendix 1, the key population classification document.

2,Adjustments from MER 1.0,Not specified,TB/HIV,FALSE,"The TB indicators have been enhanced this year to better correspond to global changes in TB policy and to better reflect the increasing emphasis on outcome. We have maintained TB_STAT and have added a disaggregate to TX_NEW and TB_ART to identify the number of new patients who have TB at the time of enrollment. These will allow us to characterize the HIV testing of TB patients, and the linkage to HIV treatment. Elements of TB_SCREEN have been transformed into a new indicator, TX_TB, which will allow us to document the number of patients who are screened for TB, and the proportion of those who are eventually started on TB therapy. Corresponding to the sharper focus of the End TB Strategy, and the emphasis on TB prevention, we have transformed TB_IPT into a new indicator, TB_PREV, which will now be required. By identifying the proportion that completes or is maintained on continuous preventive therapy, we will be able to monitor relevant outcomes, rather than just the number that initiate TB preventive therapy. These indicators will allow us to document the care cascade from TB screening to the desired outcomes: TB therapy or TB preventive therapy.",,,

These data should be collected continuously at the subnational level as part of service delivery areas.

Low final scores (reds and yellows) from these CEEs highlight potential issues with service delivery, site performance or oversight, and/or documentation of patient results. The SIMS 2.0 Linkage Reference Table provides a listing of all SIMS 2.0 CEEs that have been directly linked to a given MER indicator; linkage data may be used for data triangulation activities to inform and contextualize MER results.",,,
2,Adjustments from MER 1.0,Not specified,Expenditure Analysis (EA) & MER 2.0 Alignment,FALSE,"PEPFAR Expenditure Analysis (EA) is conducted annually in order to better understand the costs the USG incurs to provide a broad range of HIV services and support and subsequently use this information to improve program planning. Additional information about  EA methodology, process, and timeline  can be found in the EA annual Guidance. PEPFAR results reported through the MER are linked to EA  program areas to calculate a “unit expenditure” (UE). The UE represents the amount (in USD) PEPFAR spent per beneficiary reached within a program area tied to the relevant indicator. Unit expenditures are only calculated when appropriate indicators are available and align with EA expenditure reporting, and therefore EA uses only a selection of MER indicators.
The general framework of EA-MER underscores 1) The benefit of logic checks that ensure consistency and completeness in MER reporting within and across partners in an OU, and 2) that reporting to EA and MER are aligned – i.e. expenditures are reported in the same locations (at EA SNU level, typically district or province) and program areas in which results are reported (please note: expenditures can also be reported in SNUs and/or program areas in which results are not reported).

2,Adjustments from MER 1.0,Not specified,DREAMS Specific Guidance,FALSE,"In addition to required MER reporting, it is essential that all 10 DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) countries – Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe – ensure that all implementing Partners in DREAMS SNUs report their results for and use data from all 13 DREAMS-related indicators and their required disaggregations. DREAMS countries are encouraged to monitor interventions progress using custom indicators for program components that do not have existing MER indicators (e.g., contraceptive method mix, condom promotion and provision). Appendix 3 includes a full list of the DREAMS-related indicators reported for MER 2.0 and the required disaggregation for each indicator.
